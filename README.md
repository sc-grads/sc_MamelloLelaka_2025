# Hey there! Welcome to sc_MamelloLelaka_2025 🚀  

This is my little corner of GitHub where I document my journey through **data engineering, analytics, and tech exploration in 2025**. Think of it as a mix of projects, learning milestones, and personal growth—kind of like a tech diary but with more code and fewer random life updates (hopefully 😆).  

## What You’ll Find Here  

📌 **Projects**  
📖 **Learning & Certifications** – Udemy courses, new skills, and all those “aha!” moments.  
🏅 **Achievements** – Personal breakthroughs.  
🛠️ **Tech Stack** – The tools and technologies I’m working with (or struggling to understand 🤓).  
🎯 **2025 Goals** – Big aspirations, small wins, and everything in between.
